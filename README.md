# Modelling a polyurethane chain in LAMMPS

The three files (pu_in.in, pu_data.data, pu_para.params) can be used to model a small polyurethane chain in LAMMPS. The data and parameter files were created using the [Enhanced Monte Carlo Package](http://montecarlo.sourceforge.net/emc/Welcome.html) by Pieter J. in â€™t Veld. The movie was created using the [Open Visualization Tool](https://www.ovito.org/).
